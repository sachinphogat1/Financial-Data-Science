    "Correlation coefficient tells us the extent to which variables are related. `Correlation matrix` is a tool to calculate and visualize the correlation coefficients among the variables of interest. The most striking observation is the correlation coefficient of 76% between Comcast and S&P-500 indicating that there is a high correlation between these two variables. However, it is not the case for AT&T and Verizon whose correlation coefficients with S&P-500 are -52% and 55%, respectively."
